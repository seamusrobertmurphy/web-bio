  date: 2015-05-01
  description: "The WATBIO project investigates accelerated breeding for drought tolerance in poplar trees (Populus), silvergrass 
  (Miscanthus) and Arundo. Researchers established new germplasm with increased drought tolerance in Populus and Miscanthus, and 
  determined genetic diversity in Arundo. The project uses next generation sequencing technology to identify single gene-trait associations 
  capturing priority genetic variations and allelic diversity, maintaining biomass productivity in water-scarce marginal lands unsuitable for 
  food crops."
