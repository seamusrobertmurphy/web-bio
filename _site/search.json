    "text": "GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n\n      \nMy name is Seamus Murphy and I’m a registered professional forester with over 10 years of experience in forest mensuration and carbon monitoring, verification and report. I completed my PhD at SOAS, University of London in 2015 and an MSc in Environmental Forestry at Bangor University in 2019.\nI currently work as a REDD+ Consultant at Winrock International, helping market-entry carbon programs and supporting jurisdictions in strengthening their monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. I lead technical assistance to three national REDD+ programs and previously worked as a Validation and Verification Body (VVB) auditor with SCS Global Services, specializing in verification of VCS, ARB, ACR, and ART-TREES carbon offset projects. Prior to this, I held postdoctoral fellowships with the WorldFish Center and the University of Sussex, where my research focused on aquaculture markets across Egypt and Zambia. Through this work and subsequent projects involving geospatial and quantitative analyses, I repeatedly observed teams abandoning methods due to unclear documentation or resource constraints.\nThis experience sparked my passion for open source tools and reproducible science. I’ve committed to developing workflows in LiDAR processing, multispectral time series analysis, and carbon accounting systems using R and Python platforms. These workflows are specifically designed for testing with real users, including forestry technicians, carbon project developers, and government staff. My goal is to create reproducible and accessible workflows that clarify complex methodologies and empower project proponents. I bring this same commitment to field work and have designed field resources and tools including custom mobile applications for in-situ data scaling, GPS accuracy assessments (2020 & 2022), and training programs in equipment calibration and open-source survey deployment. I also facilitated theory of change workshops helping to drive development of company-wide geospatial strategies.\nYou can find my teaching resources and code repositories on my GitHub page, covering topics from Verra’s consolidated methodology (VM0048) to wildfire fuel typing and burn forecasting (CFFDRS), to validating allometric equations and running Monte Carlo uncertainty simulations (ART-TREES)."

    "text": "WATBIO: Improvement of Water-Stressed Perennial Biomass Agrifuels\n\n\nThe WATBIO project investigates accelerated breeding for drought tolerance in poplar trees (Populus), silvergrass (Miscanthus) and Arundo. Researchers established new germplasm with increased drought tolerance in Populus and Miscanthus, and determined genetic diversity in Arundo. The project uses next generation sequencing technology to identify single gene-trait associations capturing priority genetic variations and allelic diversity, maintaining biomass productivity in water-scarce marginal lands unsuitable for food crops.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZELS: Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems\n\n\nZoonoses and emerging livestock systems program (ZELS) was a joint research and training initiative to tackle diseases that could pass from animals to humans. It aims to improve the health and wellbeing of animals, humans and the environment and, ultimately, enhance the lives of millions. Research grants with a total funding of £21.1 million, with a further £1.5 million for studentships. Eleven projects are funded across 11 developing countries, involving 19 UK research institutions and more than 30 overseas institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 28, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTREAMS: Sustainable Transformation of Egyptian Aquaculture Market\n\n\nThe STREAMS project (CHF 1,999,573, SDC) aimed to increase production of inexpensive, nutritious and safe fish from sustainable aquaculture systems to improve health and nutrition of Egypt’s resource-poor while creating employment and increasing incomes. Managed by WorldFish with CARE as subcontractor, implemented across five governorates: Kafr-El-Sheikh, Fayoum, Behera, Sharkia and Menia. The project achieved significant results in transforming Egypt’s aquaculture value chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 20, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEAG: Youth Employment in Aswan Governorate\n\n\nThe Swiss-funded YEAG project (CHF 586k) benefitted 1,976 fishermen, fish farmers, women fish retailers and young entrepreneurs. It supported aquaculture development, improved post-harvest handling and fish processing practices, and developed fisheries management in Lake Nasser. The project provided training and business support to more than 1,000 fishers, ensuring better livelihoods for beneficiaries in Aswan, Upper Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLiSAT: Advancing Climate Smart Aquaculture Technologies\n\n\nThe ACLiSAT project ($1.3m, IFAD) increases adoption of efficient aquaculture technologies in arid areas, improves engagement of women and youth in productive aquaculture, and enhances collaboration between IFAD, WorldFish and regional/national partners. The project strengthens capacity of national aquaculture institutions in Egypt, Eritrea and Ethiopia and promotes the adoption of climate-smart technologies by fish farming communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWFIRE: Empowering Women Fish Retailers\n\n\nThe EWFIRE project (€396k, European Commission) focuses on making fish retailing more profitable by empowering women through technical training, market engagement and business leadership. Targeted value addition opportunities include post-harvest handling (chilling, cleaning, grading), fish processing (degutting, freezing, packaging), fish leather production, and associated fish marketing, pricing, trade contracting and consignment formalization.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 24, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZAEDP: Zambia Aquaculture Enterprise Development Project\n\n\nThe Zambia Aquaculture Enterprise Development Project aims to stimulate a viable aquaculture subsector in Zambia to promote economic diversification, food security and sustainable employment generation. The project develops domestic aquaculture as a viable and inclusive business opportunity through enhanced production and productivity. Implemented in high potential zones across the country with three components: Support to Aquaculture Entrepreneurs, Growth Enabling Infrastructure, and Project Management. Total cost: USD 50.89 million (ADB loan: USD 45.4 million, GRZ: USD 5.49 million).\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nERFI: Enhanced Forest Resource Inventories\n\n\nThis project implemented a comprehensive pointcloud-to-raster workflow for enhanced forest inventory, generating spatial estimates of Whole Stem Volume (m³/ha). The pipeline processes LiDAR data, derives key covariates including canopy height models and terrain features, and uses machine learning (Random Forest) to predict forest volume across landscapes. Services included individual stem detection, automated stand delineation, and stock table creation.\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkwoods: Forest Carbon Project\n\n\nThe Nature Conservancy of Canada acquired the 54,792 ha Darkwoods Property near Creston, British Columbia, managing it for ecological conservation. NCC undertook a 100-year VCS IFM-LtPF forest carbon project to provide carbon finance for acquisition and ongoing management. The project achieves GHG emission reductions through avoided logging, implementing conservation management activities with minimal timber removal for ecosystem enhancement and risk management.\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 1, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAF: Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition\n\n\nThe LEAF Coalition is a voluntary global coalition bringing together the private sector and governments to provide carbon market finance for tropical and subtropical forest conservation. LEAF has mobilized $1 billion USD for forest country governments committed to protecting forests and reducing deforestation. The Coalition is on track to become one of the largest public-private efforts to protect tropical forests, with 23 jurisdictions potentially protecting up to half a billion hectares of forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 14, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
