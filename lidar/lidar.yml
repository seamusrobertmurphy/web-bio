  date: 2022-03-12
  description: "LiDAR workflow for mapping ash dieback disease *(Hymenoscyphus fraxineus)* using high-resolution point cloud data and field validation. Combines canopy metrics with ground data to detect disease progression patterns, quantify canopy gaps from ash mortality, and map stem distribution changes over time. Features automated algorithms for identifying healthy versus declining ash trees through LiDAR-derived crown metrics, supporting targeted forest health interventions and silvicultural planning in diseased stands."
