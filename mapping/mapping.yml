  description: "Collection of site maps, including static maps designed for field operations teams and interactive maps for collective review of waypoints or target locations. Static maps were derived to ensure customizable basemaps, project boundary delineation, geographic coordinate grid and graticule cross-hairs. Legends were added using tmap functions that ensure minimum cartographic features are rendered including scale bars and north arrows."
