::: {#hero-heading}
My name is Seamus Murphy and I'm a registered forester specializing in forest mensuration and carbon verification. I completed my PhD at SOAS, University of London in 2015 and an MSc in Environmental Forestry at Bangor University in 2019.

Currently, I work as a REDD+ Consultant at [Winrock International](https://winrock.org/), leading technical support for project-level and jurisdictional carbon programs. Previously, I worked as carbon offset auditor with SCS Global Services and conducted postdoctoral research on aquaculture markets across Egypt and Zambia.

Over the years, I've observed brilliant methodologies fail because they were too complex or poorly documented. This sparked my commitment to open source tools and reproducible research. I develop workflows in [LiDAR processing](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/gov_sk_tree_height_variability), [multispectral time series analysis](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/mapping-endorheic-wetland-dynamics), and [carbon accounting systems](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/art-trees-submission/) using R and Python platforms, and test them with real users. This also includes reproducible field tools and workflows, such as [in-situ data scaling](https://seamusmurphy.shinyapps.io/shiny-project-V8/), GPS accuracy assessments ([2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/126oyAzNCa386aIZLus7oO3_kk9PRmnAd/view?usp=sharing) & [2022](https://viewscreen.githubusercontent.com/view/pdf?browser=safari&bypass_fastly=true&color_mode=dark&commit=9a09556452d67378b9d3657d4ba537993426889a&device=unknown_device&docs_host=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f7365616d7573726f626572746d75727068792f4750532d747261696e696e672d6d6174657269616c2f396130393535363435326436373337386239643336353764346261353337393933343236383839612f475053253230534f502532302d253230526f6164253230537572766579253230696e253230455352492532304669656c644d6170732e706466&link_underline_enabled=true&logged_in=true&nwo=seamusrobertmurphy%2FGPS-training-material&path=GPS+SOP+-+Road+Survey+in+ESRI+FieldMaps.pdf&platform=mac&repository_id=691993657&repository_type=Repository&version=18#56d1471b-3313-4786-9de3-4b7cd916e501)), [equipment calibration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKMX_JB21j3FkHIiZ1dzqFHFGgdaIdgb/view?usp=sharing) and [open-source survey deployment](https://eu.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms/ajw7YvwXFgCgVaaAiz9Xrm/data/map). You can explore my resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/seamusrobertmurphy/), covering everything from carbon methodologies ([VM0048](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/vm0048/)) to wildfire fuel typing ([CFFDRS](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/cffdrs/)), to validating allometry ([ART-TREES](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/art-trees-monte-carlo-uncertainty)).
