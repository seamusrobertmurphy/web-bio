My name is Seamus Murphy and I'm a registered professional forester with over 10 years of experience in forest mensuration and carbon monitoring, verification and report. I completed my PhD at SOAS, University of London in 2015 and an MSc in Environmental Forestry at Bangor University in 2019.

I currently work as a REDD+ Consultant at [Winrock International](https://winrock.org/), helping market-entry carbon programs and supporting jurisdictions in strengthening their monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. I lead technical assistance to three national REDD+ programs and previously worked as a Validation and Verification Body (VVB) auditor with SCS Global Services, specializing in verification of VCS, ARB, ACR, and ART-TREES carbon offset projects. Prior to this, I held postdoctoral fellowships with the WorldFish Center and the University of Sussex, where my research focused on aquaculture markets across Egypt and Zambia. Through this work and subsequent projects involving geospatial and quantitative analyses, I repeatedly observed teams abandoning methods due to unclear documentation or resource constraints.

This experience sparked my passion for open source tools and reproducible science. I've committed to developing workflows in [LiDAR processing](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/gov_sk_tree_height_variability), [multispectral time series analysis](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/mapping-endorheic-wetland-dynamics), and [carbon accounting systems](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/art-trees-submission/) using R and Python platforms. These workflows are specifically designed for testing with real users, including forestry technicians, carbon project developers, and government staff. My goal is to create reproducible and accessible workflows that clarify complex methodologies and empower project proponents. I bring this same commitment to field work and have designed field resources and tools including custom mobile applications for [in-situ data scaling](https://seamusmurphy.shinyapps.io/shiny-project-V8/), GPS accuracy assessments ([2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/126oyAzNCa386aIZLus7oO3_kk9PRmnAd/view?usp=sharing) & [2022](https://viewscreen.githubusercontent.com/view/pdf?browser=safari&bypass_fastly=true&color_mode=dark&commit=9a09556452d67378b9d3657d4ba537993426889a&device=unknown_device&docs_host=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f7365616d7573726f626572746d75727068792f4750532d747261696e696e672d6d6174657269616c2f396130393535363435326436373337386239643336353764346261353337393933343236383839612f475053253230534f502532302d253230526f6164253230537572766579253230696e253230455352492532304669656c644d6170732e706466&link_underline_enabled=true&logged_in=true&nwo=seamusrobertmurphy%2FGPS-training-material&path=GPS+SOP+-+Road+Survey+in+ESRI+FieldMaps.pdf&platform=mac&repository_id=691993657&repository_type=Repository&version=18#56d1471b-3313-4786-9de3-4b7cd916e501)), and training programs in [equipment calibration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKMX_JB21j3FkHIiZ1dzqFHFGgdaIdgb/view?usp=sharing) and [open-source survey deployment](https://eu.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms/ajw7YvwXFgCgVaaAiz9Xrm/data/map). I also facilitated theory of change workshops helping to drive development of company-wide [geospatial strategies](https://github.com/seamusrobertmurphy/GPS-training-material/blob/main/Geospatial%20Strategy%20-%20Proposal%20Development.pdf).

You can find my teaching resources and code repositories on my [GitHub](https://github.com/seamusrobertmurphy/) page, covering topics from Verra's consolidated methodology ([VM0048](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/vm0048/)) to wildfire fuel typing and burn forecasting ([CFFDRS](https://seamusrobertmurphy.quarto.pub/cffdrs/)), to validating allometric equations and running Monte Carlo uncertainty simulations ([ART-TREES](https://rpubs.com/seamusmurphy/art-trees-monte-carlo-uncertainty)).
