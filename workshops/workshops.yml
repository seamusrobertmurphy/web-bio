  description: "Statistical validation and calibration procedures for allometric biomass models compliant with ART-TREES requirements for carbon registry emissions reporting. Technical guidance in model selection methodology is specifically aimed at avoiding Types 1-4 statistical errors and over-fitting. Carbon registries mandate robust model selection protocols to monitor predictive accuracy for signs of systematic bias and apply correction through hyper parameter tuning."
